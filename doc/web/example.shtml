<h1>An example</h1>

<p>
(Before you start on your own project please read
<a href="index.shtml#rel-0.9.0">this</a> release note.)
</p>

<p>
The base image is a Libary of
Congress <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/bbc.0701f/">public
domain image</a> of a baseball card from circa 1910.
</p>

<p>
<img class="blockImg" src="images/mcOriginal.jpg" alt="Image of
McIntyre baseball card" />
</p>
<div class="imgTitleSmall">The original image.</div>

<p>
Start cstitch and click the folder icon on the toolbar
<img class="inlineImg" src="images/open.png" alt="open icon" /> to
open the image.  The first step is to choose the colors to use for the
pattern.  The default mode (visible on the toolbar) is "Num colors to
DMC" with a default color count of 80, meaning the program will choose
80 DMC colors for you.  (Briefly, DMC colors are colors that are
available as cross stitch thread.)  The original image has 68,439
colors, but the image was obviously printed with far fewer colors, so
we started by trying 20 colors (change the 80 to 20 on the toolbar and
click "Choose colors").  The result was too flat, so we go back and
try 30 (if you're not on the first screen anymore, click the
<img class="inlineImg" src="images/stage1.png" alt="stage 1 icon" />
icon on the toolbar).  Here's the result, which we were satisfied
with:
</p>

<p>
<img class="blockImg" src="images/mcCompare30.jpg"
     alt="The McIntyre image reduced to 30 colors" />
</p>
<div class="imgTitleSmall">The original image reduced to 30 colors.</div>

<p>
The next step "squares" the 30-color image by overlaying a grid on the
image and then making each square in the grid a solid color.  The size
of the image, the size of the grid squares, and the type of cross
stitch fabric you use will determine how large your final product will
be.  To have the program do the math for you, click on "Compute
dimensions" under the Image menu - as you change the square size at
the top the final dimensions for your pattern using various fabric
types are updated below. We don't know what type of fabric we'll be
using yet, but we want the final product to be smaller than a sheet of
paper, so we're going with a square size of 5 (which means the program
will lay down a grid line on the image every 5 pixels).  The larger
the square size, the smaller the final product will be.  Click the
"Square" button on the toolbar to produce the square image:
</p>

<p>
<img class="blockImg" src="images/mcSquareUnedited28.jpg"
     alt="square McIntyre image with 28 colors" />
</p>
<div class="imgTitleMedium">A squared image with 28 colors.</div>

<p>
If you're following along in the program you'll notice that the color
count dropped from 30 to 28!  The program chooses just one color for
each square, so it looks like 2 colors didn't make the cut (they
probably didn't appear enough in the image to get chosen to represent
the square(s) they appeared in).  There's no way to tell ahead of time
how many colors will be dropped, but you can always go back and
restart if you're unhappy with the new count.
</p>

<p>
Some might say the squared image doesn't look very good, and normally
we would agree!  There are a couple of options at this point.  You
could go back to the previous stage and make the square size smaller
to keep more detail, but then the final size of your pattern would
change.  Another option would be to go back to the start and rerun the
first two stages with more initial colors.  If we start with 60 colors
instead of 30, we get a square image with 51 colors that looks quite a
bit better:
</p>

<p>
  <img class="blockImg" src="images/mcSquare51.jpg"
       alt="square McIntyre image with 51 colors" />
</p>
<div class="imgTitleMedium">A squared image with 51 colors.</div>

<p>
But now we need 51 colors of thread instead of 28, so for the purposes
of illustration we'll instead use the square drawing tools to edit the
28-color image above to see if we can make it a bit better.  The tools
are above the color list and include a tool to draw on the image with
the mouse, a tool to fill areas with a given color, a tool to change a
color throughout the image, and a "detail" tool - check out
the <a href="doc.shtml#squareTools">main documentation</a> for more
information on exactly what the tools do and how to use them.  Another
useful function when editing is the "Remove rare colors" function
found under the Image menu - use it to replace colors that only appear
a few times in the image with similar colors that already appear
more often.
</p>

<p>
The result of editing by hand:
</p>

<p>
  <img class="blockImg" src="images/mcSquareEdited23.jpg"
       alt="edited square McIntyre image with 23 colors" />
</p>
<div class="imgTitleMedium">The final edited squared image with 23
colors.</div>

<p>
Note that the color count actually fell from 28 to 23 while editing
since we removed some "rare" colors that were only used in 5 or fewer
squares (you can specify whatever number you like in place of 5).  We
also removed the name at the bottom of the image and the "B" on the
cap since small features like letters don't come out well when
squared, and we made the border around the main part of the image one
solid color since we like it better that way.  Creating a good pattern
requires a certain amount of artistry, something that humans are still
much better at than computers!  You should expect to have to do some
editing unless you're willing to use a lot of colors and/or a small
square size.
</p>

<p>
Now click "Pattern" to choose pattern symbols for colors.  Colors and
their symbols are listed on the right, while the main image is
enlarged so that you can read the symbol for each square - to get
around you can right click on the image to switch to the square color
view, or click/drag your mouse in the preview image in the upper right
corner to move the red preview box.  If you don't want to change any
of the symbols, then just click the "To pdf" button on the toolbar.
Enter any title and copyright/licensing you want to appear in the pdf
and then click Ok to save your pattern to a pdf file.  Note that the
size of the squares in the pdf pattern will be based on the size of
the squares appearing in the image on the screen, so you can zoom in
or out on the image on the screen before pressing the "To pdf" button
to change the pdf square size.
</p>

<p>
Here are some patterns I get from my image using three different zoom
levels to save: at four zooms in from the default size
<a href="images/McIntyre-smaller.pdf">McIntyre_smaller.pdf</a>,
at the default zoom size
<a href="images/McIntyre-default.pdf">McIntyre_default.pdf</a>,
and at four zooms out from the default size
<a href="images/McIntyre-larger.pdf">McIntyre_larger.pdf</a>.  The
program decides automatically whether to print the pattern pages in
landscape or portrait mode in order to minimize the number of pages
needed - in this case the smaller version printed in portrait mode,
while the other two printed in landscape mode.
</p>

<p>
At this point it would be a good idea to save the work you've done so
that if you decide later that you want to make more edits or save a
new pattern size, for example, you won't have to start over from
scratch.  Click the "save project" button <img class="inlineImg"
src="images/saveProject.png" alt="the save project icon" /> on the
toolbar to save your project to a file.  What gets saved are all of
the images from the four stages, plus any editing history and other
settings you might have changed.  (Actually, the original image is
saved but all that's saved for the other images are the options needed
to reproduce them.)  Here's the project file for the McIntyre
project: <a href="images/McIntyre.xst">McIntyre.xst</a>.  If you'd like to
take a look, just save the file to your computer and then use the
"Open project" button <img class="inlineImg" src="images/openProject.png"
alt='The "Open project" icon' /> on the toolbar to load it.
